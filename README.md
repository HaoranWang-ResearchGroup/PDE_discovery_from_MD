Included in this repository are:
1. Monte carlo (MC) simulation data used for PDE identification
2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data used for PDE identification
3. LAMMPS input file for PDE validation, Case 1: linear initial C profile
4. LAMMPS input file for PDE validation, Case 2: exponential initial C profile

They are used in our manuscript, Learning the Governing PDE of Solid Diffusion from Atomistic Simulations, by Wongelemengist Nadew and Haoran Wang
